# testing life cycle

### Testing types and process a lifecycle could include

#### 1. Planning & Documentation

Planning from QA involves the following activities: 

* Test plan \(including risk analysis\)
* Estimation 
* Test Design  \(our experience to guess errors e.g. idempotency\)
* Ensuring there will be sufficient environments 

#### 2. Structural Testing

Structural testing will test the foundations of what we produce through:

* Unit tests
* Integrations for any APIs accepting, validating and responding to requests as expected

#### 3. Functional Testing

Functional testing will be carried out by QA through the following methods:

* Manual testing
* Compatibility testing through specified browsers and devices
* Exploratory testing
* UI Automation

#### 4. Non-Functional Testing

Non functional testing carried out for the following where appropriate:

* Usability & accessibility testing
* Load, volume & stress testing
* Performance & best practice
* Security & pen testing

#### 5 .Test Closure, UAT & Maintenance Testing

* Regression testing
* Document test summary \(any remaining risks\)
* UAT support with documentation
* Monitor live environment
* Impact analysis of any changes \(according to the likelihood of impact and what areas the change may impact\)
