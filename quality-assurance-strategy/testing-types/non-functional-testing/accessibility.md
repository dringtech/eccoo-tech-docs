### Aim

To meet WCAG 2.1 AAA

### Accessibility Audit

A full accessibility audit will need to be carried out to see if the site. Example of all the criteria that will need to be assessed:

This needs knowledge of accessibility as well as being able to use screen readers efficiently.

### Plan

#### Assistive technology

For the platform to be accessible across our chosen devices and browsers by people using the following technology:

* Mouse
* Keyboard 
* Screenreader
* Screen magnifier
* Speech recognition
* Switch
* Eyetracker



#### Manual testing 

  
  
Steering with keyboard - can users navigate entire app, accessing all elements using default keys such as tab, shift + tab, enter, space, arrow keys. Ensure that 'skip to content' links consistent throughout the app.

Screen readers - navigate site with monitor off using NVDA \(Windows\), VoiceOver \(mac and iOS\), \(need to research most popular Android screenreader - possibly Talkback\)

Magnification - Layout and design is still coherent when user has magnified \(research typical maximum magnification level\)

#### Automated tools

WAVE, pa11y, HTML CodeSniffer \(These were chosen based on the data in this table: [https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/index.html](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/index.html)\)
