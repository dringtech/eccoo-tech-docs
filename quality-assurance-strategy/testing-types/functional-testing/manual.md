### What is Manual Testing? <a id="IntroductiontoManualTesting-WhatisManualTesting?"></a>

Manual testing is a technique where tests are carried out against by a tester against specified tests without the use of any automated tools. This is not concerned with testing the structure of the application but rather that the application behaves as expected.

### Use pre-defined tests <a id="ApproachtoManualTesting-Usepre-definedtests"></a>

Tests should be defined before QA come to through acceptance tests or at the very least through acceptance criteria.
