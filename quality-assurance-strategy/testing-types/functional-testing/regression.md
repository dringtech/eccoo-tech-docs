### What is regression testing? <a id="IntroductiontoRegressionTesting-Whatisregressiontesting?"></a>

Regression testing is defined as a type testing that confirms a code change has not adversely affected existing features. It tests all of the complex user stories and detailed functionality of the site meaning it can may take many hours to complete. 

Regression testing can be carried out through a full or partial selection of already executed test cases which are re-executed to ensure existing functionalities work as expected as new code changes should not have side effects on the existing functionalities. It ensures that the old code still works once the new code changes are done.

### Regression pack

Regression will need to be documented on test case by test case basis so we can see what needs to be executed and what is/isn't automated

### Versioning <a id="ApproachtoRegressionTesting-Versioning"></a>

Each regression pack will need to be versioned to match the release \(if there is no release version the regression pack should be dated\). This will help keep track of what was regression tested for each release.

### Test Case Prioritisation <a id="ApproachtoRegressionTesting-TestCasePrioritisation"></a>

One of the biggest challenges is having the sufficient time to execute all test cases which may be unlikely in a large project. To help mitigate this we can execute test cases based on prioritisation; this helps will enable us to run test cases of higher priority in order to minimise time, cost and effort when required.
