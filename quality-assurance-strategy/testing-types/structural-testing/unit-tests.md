### What is Unit Testing? <a id="Unit(Component)Testing-WhatisUnitTesting?"></a>

Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently checked to ensure they work as expected. These are automated and can be run again and again to ensure the tests pass event after new functionality has been added. 

### Who carries out Unit Testing? <a id="Unit(Component)Testing-WhocarriesoutUnitTesting?"></a>

Unit tests may be helped through written acceptance tests but other than that QA have no other involvement. The Development Team will cover testing units of code through automated unit tests when writing code and before passing to QA to test a feature.
