# source code management

* Use a git-based repo hosted in the cloud \(Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket\)
* Select a workflow such as GitFlow, Github Flow. Keep this as simple as possible, but enabling the required release strategy.
* Closed source to start with - needs to be a coop decision to open source. Aspiration is openness, but need to recognise the commercial value. Should look to release components as open source.
