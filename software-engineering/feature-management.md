## Ready for Sprint

Stories are **Ready for Sprint** when:

* Clear and unambigous descriptions are attached to the story. These need to be supported by the UX designs and any linked reading, or explicitly diverge from them. Any divergence must be documented in the story description.
* Acceptance criteria are fully and clearly defined. Acceptance criteria should be testable. For many this will be a simple binary and it will be clear how testing is to be completed. For more complex acceptance criteria, the mechanism by which testing is to be completed must also be documented.
* The story is estimated with Estimated Work \(**Tiny** to **Project Size**\). Any stories which are bigger than **Large** should really be broken into separate stories. Even **Large** is probably too big...
