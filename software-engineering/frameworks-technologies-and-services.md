# frameworks, technologies and services

## Application Code

### NestJS

The bespoke services are written in [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). This is a JavaScript / TypeScript framework which provides a strong structure on top of the Express framework. It makes heavy use of structures such as classes and [modularisation](https://docs.nestjs.com/modules), and software engineering techniques like [dependency injection](https://docs.nestjs.com/providers). This means that the code should be easily testable and maintainable. It also means that there is a bit more of a learning curve getting up to speed.

The UI and Graph API layer are built using NestJS.

Resources:

* [Documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/)
* [First Steps](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps)
* The Overview and Fundamentals sections of the documentation provide a good overview of the core of NestJS. Other sections can be dipped into as required.
