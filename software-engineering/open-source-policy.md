# open source policy

Much of the digital stuff we use these days is built with open source software. There are a number of benefits to this:

* Broader support from the community - for more popular products at least
* Ability to see / review the code that is being used
* Potential for others to contribute to improve quality of our codebase / componentry
* No lock in to large software vendors

On the downside, there is a risk that intellectual property is inadvertently released, undermining the commercial value of code that has been developed.

For now, we will keep the core platform closed source. This has implications on the types of open source software that can be used. We must take care when using [share alike or copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share-alike) licenses, which stipulate that variants of the software must be shared under a similar license. This is known as a viral license. We will prefer [permissive licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license).

We may make exceptions when considering small, non-platform specific elements. These could be licensed under the [ISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) \(Internet Systems Consortium\) license, which is a simple, permissive license.
