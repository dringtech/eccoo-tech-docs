# architectural principles

### Hats!

One of our core principles is that you can give or receive support at any time in your life. We all do both, one or the other at different times \(of the day, of the year, of our lives\). Too often, the caring industry confuses these roles with our identities. People become service users and organisations shape themselves around this idea of a fixed identity of someone who uses social care services. Or people become care workers and organisations shape themselves around the idea that care workers don't need help, care, kindness and support themselves. People internalise these identities and this makes being on the other side of the coin much harder.

Examples of hats might be: paid, independent care and support worker, person paying directly for their own care and support, trainer, team co-ordinator, Blackshaw circle facilitator, inspector, family member contributing to lots of the care and support themselves...

Some examples of how this might show up in eccoo are:

* A tech specification that relies on a single core identity \(i.e. a human being\) for authentication purposes but then assigns roles \("hats"\) based on graph technology rather than fixed databases.
* An agnostic view over who has the potential to wear these hats and user journey flows that model ways in which people might transition from hat to hat and add a hat to their hatstand.

### Visibility, coupled with control

Data literacy amongst the general population is extremely poor. We want to raise literacy about data and data use simply through the experience of accessing and using eccoo. 

Some examples of how this might show up in eccoo are:

* Users of the platform can choose who sees their information at the level of the individual rather than the organisation. This includes times when they haven't given their consent to share it with somebody, allowing them to see who has accessed their care and support notes and why \(for example, a safeguarding concern, a quality audit or a visit from the regulator\)
* Independent care and support workers can agree to or opt out of being GPS tracked in order to let people they're supporting know where they are and have an audit trail.
* People being supported can state whether they want everyone supporting them to be GPS tracked or if they don't mind.
* A properly mapped, empathic and empirical approach to consent, using \(for example\) illustration, video and walk throughs to move people from a state of passive to active consent and participation in how they approach their data rights.

### **Hyper-accessibility**

Accessible formats can feel stigmatising. We want to re-place ideas of accessibility along the same continuum of preference and personalisation. Perhaps you're more of a words person or you prefer to take in information aurally. You'll find that equal weight has been given to your ears as has been given to your eyes and your hands.

Some examples of how this might show up in eccoo are:

* Taking a radical, multi-sensory approach to accessibility. In addition to full disability access \(such as Easy Read, hearing loop, braille, web compliant etc\), our organisational content will be available in multiple formats, such as animated summaries, audio files narrated by content authors and storyboard illustrations. We see an unbroken continuum between condition-specific accessibility features and personal preferences.
* A multi-channel service: if you do not want to engage at all with digital technology then you can still use the service direct without having to depend on an intermediary. For example, this could include a phone call to start with and move to letters, then a face to face visit to decide together who the best person to support you will be.
* Workers offer communication specialisms to match the need \(e.g. Total Communication, expressive language, graphic facilitation\)
* Making full use of the scope of technology communication and participation aids, including staying fully up to date with new products and services in this space
* Co-creating, maintaining and evaluating our accessibility tools with the people who will be using them
* Giving equal or greater weight to our ‘accessible’ versions, with beautiful, thoughtful production, authorship and design

### Labour is recognised and valued, wherever it comes from

This is a bit like hats, but is a separate principle because it's about value, recognition and a driver to different technologies. We see caring as an abundant resource, not scarce. People getting support have valuable skills, time, experience which we shouldn’t waste. They can help others too. Care can consist of anything from a cup of tea and a chat, doing the shopping with/for someone and cooking a meal through to talking about dreams and aspirations and offering specialised clinical expertise to specific client groups.

With a broad definition of who can support others, this opens up people’s spare time from other jobs where they can earn a bit extra or volunteer their support. It also means that people getting support are seen as people able to give it \(hence the crossover with the hats principles\).

Some examples of how this might show up in eccoo are:

* Skillsharing opportunities have a space on the platform. People are able to showcase their skills and experience for others to ask for.
* The role of volunteering is essential to achieving this, but should not be a poorer cousin to the paid work. To create mass incentive for volunteering, we need a means of exchange – Care Coins. These may be generated through earning shares in the company at the same rate for paid and volunteer work, which could then be exchanged for other forms of labour or for dividend. Hence \(one of\) the reasons for using a distributed ledger.
