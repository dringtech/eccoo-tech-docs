# identity and access subsystem

The Identity and Access subsystem is responsible for the security of the overall platform. This will ensure that the users are uniquely and securely [identified](identity-component.md) when [logged on](authentication.md), enabling [authorised](authorisation.md) \(and preventing unauthorised\) access to features, functions and data. It will also [track access](audit-component.md) to sensitive information for audit purposes.
