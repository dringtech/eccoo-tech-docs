# transactions subsystem

This subsystem collects a series of components which underpin the transfer of value across the platform. The value exchanged could be in the form of:

* paid caregiving appointments
* financial payments
* ad-hoc volunteer social calls

Each of these describes the platform economy, and needs to be underpinned by a trustworthy ledger. This is a potential application of blockchain-type technologies.

Although the initial MVP implementation will likely be a simple network, it is possible that as the platform grows there will be a need to distribute transactions across a network. The power of a distributed ledger database network \(a.k.a. blockchain\) is that it radically decentralises the data storage, underpinning trust through exchange of encrypted data.
