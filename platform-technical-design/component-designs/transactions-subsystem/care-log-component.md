# care log

Care logging is the record of caring interactions that have taken place, and captures the transfer of value enabled by the platform. It is the other half of the platform core along with the [relationships](../relationships-subsystem/relationship-component.md) component.

This will be some form of ledger DB.

## Critical requirements

* Must be a non-repudiable storage of transactions \(i.e. a non-editable and therefore trustworthy record\)
* Should facilitate the 'eccoo transaction fee' \(?\)

## Implementation

This could be an application for distributed ledger \(blockchain\) technology.

Required API:

* Register care transaction
* Confirm care transaction

## Reference

The following provides a good overview of RDBMS, NoSQL, Ledger DB.
