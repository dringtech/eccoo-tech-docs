# channels subsystem

The channels subsystem is responsible for user-initiated platform interaction. This is where the 'apps' reside: be they websites, single-page apps or AI-based voice assistants.

The MVP scope will include [sign-up](sign-up-component.md), [individual profile](individual-profile-component.md) and [notifications](notification-management-component.md). There should be a means of undertaking [guided performance](guided-performance-component.md).

Future channels are likely to include voice.
