# sign-up

The sign-up component is a process manager responsible for interacting with the core components within the system to establish a new user of the system.

## C​ritical requirements

* Manage the process of sign up
* Collect required customer data

## ​Implementation

Sign up is a component which could in principle be implemented by altering the current solution: JotForm. As long as the JotForm platform can support arbitrary solution integrations, it could be used to create the individual profile.

It may be required to unpick some of the JotForm implementation which (it is assumed) follows the UX design fairly closely.
