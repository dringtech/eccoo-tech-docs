# relationships



The relationship component will implement a [social graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph), similar to the graph underpinning social media platforms such as Facebook.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is important to distinguish between the concept of a social graph and the implementation of such well-known commercial Social Networks. The former merely stores the relationships between entities \(e.g. people\), whereas the latter attempts to use this knowledge for shareholder gain. It is, in other words, a question of intent.
