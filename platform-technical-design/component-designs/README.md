# component designs

This section of the book adds more details to the main building blocks outlined in the [architecture overview](../architecture-overview.md). The detailed design will need to take place closer to implementation, once the requirements have been more fully explored. The reason for outlining here is to map out the territory and prevent the development team heading off in a direction which seems sensible given the focus of a delivery effort, but fails to take into account the bigger picture.

Each component description begins with a brief summary of the purpose and responsibilities of the component.

This is followed by a section listing **critical requirements**. These are written using [MoSCoW prioritisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method): Must - Should - Could - Won't \(...yet\).

Next comes a section with **implementation** guidance, including any product selection, technical standards or initial design that has been done.
