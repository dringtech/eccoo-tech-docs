# component designs

Each component description begins with a brief summary of the purpose of the component.

This is followed by a section listing **critical requirements**. These are \(or at least should be\) written using [MoSCoW prioritisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method): Must - Should - Could - Won't.

Next comes a section with **implementation** guidance, including any product selection.
