# platform technical design



The Platform Tech Design exists to provide guidance for developers of the platform. It aims to inform rather than direct, and as such will not form a complete technical design. It will, instead, focus on the critical system elements that underpin the platform. These should be aligned to the ethos of Equal Care Co-op as a whole: an alignment underpinned by the [architectural principles](architectural-principles.md).

The rest of this document comprises the following sections:

* The next section outlines the [critical requirements](critical-requirements.md) that must be met by the system. These are largely what are termed 'non-functional' or 'operational' requirements, as the functionality will be ultimately covered by the stories.
* The [architecture overview](architecture-overview.md) opens the black box to outline the important 'moving parts' of the solution. It identifies the major components and services that comprise the platform. Each of these needs to be brought to life.
* The [component designs](component-designs/) section illustrates these building blocks, providing guidance on the most critical aspects detailing their design. These may provide guidance on platform, technology and design, although in the first instance they will remain at the conceptual level.
* The [infrastructure design](infrastructure-design.md) provides an overview of the hosting environments \(for there shall be many!\) which underpin the platform. This is where questions about development / test / live platforms are answered.
* Finally, the [architecture decisions](architecture-decisions.md) section documents the rationale for important platform decisions. This provides transparency in the decision making process, and ensures that any new team members can be informed on prior discussions \(subtext: to avoid having the discussions again, _unless_ there is something new brought to the table!\)
