# critical requirements

## Quality attributes

This section outlines the quality \(rather than functional\) characteristics that the platform must meet.

### Accessibility

The UI components must be designed to appropriate accessibility standards. At a minimum, this must include:

* W3C [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for Web Content - up to AAA level where appropriate
* W3C [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) for Dynamic Web Apps

There are excellent resources available at the [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/).

The system should support users with complex needs. Hyper-accessibility.

### Internationalisation \(i18n\) and Localisation \(l10n\)

The platform may ultimately be used in multiple countries: as such, all platform components should be internationalised so that they can be easily localised.
