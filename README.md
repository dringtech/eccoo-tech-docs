This book outlines the [platform technical design](platform-technical-design/) and [software engineering](software-engineering/) approaches.

### Some points of language:

#### Equal Care Co-op or Equal Care

The name of the co-operative organisation that runs through, around and with the platform.

#### Eccoo \(if at the beginning of a sentence\) or eccoo \(if anywhere else in a sentence or heading\)

The name of the platform itself.

For more style and content stuff go [here ](https://policies.equalcare.coop/-LeSN56IfWNpY00mY12i/writing-policy/content)\(mostly aimed at policy-writing but we're going for a style that doesn't really care whether you're writing a policy or a blog or an email\).
