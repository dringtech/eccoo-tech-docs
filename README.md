# introduction

The platform is critical to our aspiration to spread our vision to make a difference across care work in the UK and beyond. It will \(eventually\) support every relationship made and every caring interaction by our members.

This book outlines the [platform technical design](platform-technical-design/) and [software engineering](software-engineering/) approaches that will underpin the platform, as well as the [user experience design](user-experience-design/) focussing on the MVP - Minimum Viable Product - that we need to build to support this growth.

The purpose of the MVP is...

> ...to match people who require care and support with those who can provide it and facilitate paid and voluntary bookings.

### Some points of language:

#### Equal Care Co-op or Equal Care

The name of the co-operative organisation that runs through, around and with the platform.

#### Eccoo \(if at the beginning of a sentence\) or eccoo \(if anywhere else in a sentence or heading\)

The name of the platform itself.
